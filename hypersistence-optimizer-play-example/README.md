# Hypersistence Optimizer Play Framework example

This project demonstrates how to integrate Hypersistence Optimizer with Play Framework.

The project is based on the [`play-java-jpa-example`](https://github.com/playframework/play-samples/tree/2.8.x/play-java-jpa-example) project offered by the Play Framework team.

All you need to do is import it in IntelliJ IDEA and run the `PlayFrameworkTest`.
